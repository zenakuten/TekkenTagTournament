Overview
****************************

This FAQ is not for the beginner or even intermediate Tekken player.
This FAQ deals with advanced techniques and terminology that can best
be understood by advanced Tekken players.  Almost all of the
information in this FAQ has come from internet BBS's, the authors'
own experiences, and frame data analysis.  It is a culmination of all
of the secrets discovered by the experts.  For a better understanding
of the terms used in this FAQ, consult www.tekkenzaibastu.com.

And now, on to the good stuff...


****************************
General tricks
****************************

If a flying chop (WR+1+2) is blocked below the knees, a basic
punch/kick is garanteed and juggles.

Crouch cancel: When a move recovers crouching, if you tap u or f,f
on the last frame of the recovery of the move, it will instead
recover standing.  This makes juggles like Yoshi's D,df+3, d+1,
cc + 1, ff+4 possible.

Instant WS:  If you do d~db,N,button, you will  do a WS move that
comes out quicker than just doing D,N+button.  The reason for this
is that you have to hold D for a certain number of frames before the
CPU knows that you are going into a crouching position and not
attempting a sidestep (d~N).  Doing d~db,N+button skips this sidestep
check.  An alternate method of doing the Instant WS is by doing
d~df,N, button.

Natural low parry:  If you do a natural low parry (d+1+3/d+2+4 with
most characters that have it) and you don't do anything
(e.g. d+1+3, N) you will be considered standing during the low parry
animation and can do standing moves.  If you hold down during the low
parry animation you will be considered crouching when the low parry
animation is over and you can do FC moves.  This is a faster way to
get into crouching position than just holding D because it again
skips the check to see if you are sidesteping (d~N).


1+2+3+4 super charge:  if you tag out, your tag in character will be
super charged.

HaHa step for everybody:  qcb~N~b repeat.  If you do it correctly it
should be as smooth as Lei's.  You may notice that the qcb~N~b is
just like doing a Mishima wave step backwards.

You recover from a jump crouching, good for WS/FC setups like Bryan
jump into C.O.M or Chang's jump->D,df+4,3.


JOT (Jump-over-tricks):
Jumping is good vs a grounded opponent as you can jump over them and
then d+1 them and make them get up backturned for free WS+2 or
whatever.  Example, you SS to your opponents side while they are
grounded then you jump over them.  They get up thinking you messed up
by jumping but then you d+1 them and make them get backwards.  Moves
that jump over grounded are even better than just jumping over them
as it has an even stronger appearance that you messed up when
actually you are setting them up.

Good moves for jump-over-tricks:


Anna/Nina's uf+4

A.Kings CD+3?

Baek 3+4, uf+2?

Michelle: ff+2

Mishimas: f,N,d,df,f,uf (little crouch-dash-hop-thingy)

Hwoarang: ff+4

Kuma/Panda: uf+1+2

Kuni/Yoshi: uf+3+4

Lee: uf+3 ?


Escaping from being back turned:  If you get knocked backwards or
tricked into getting up backwards, etc, one of the best ways to get
out of it is to perform a throw.  The throw attempt will turn you
around as quickly as a BK d+1 will, but you don't have to worry about
getting CH like you do with d+1.


Netsu oddities:  Moves that do no damage but cause a stun (like anna's
df+1+2 or a taunt) count as a hit towards netsu powerup.

Throw escapes:  When a throw is attempted, the animation for the
throw attempt will show either the left hand out further, the right
hand out further, or both hands equal, which correlates to the
escape of the throw.  So if you just watch the characters hands
as they are trying to throw you, you will be able to tell the escape
before it even connects.  Difficult, but not impossible.  You just
need to always pay close attention to your opponent characters hands
when you are in throw range.

Also, regardless of what you may have heard, you only get 1 attempt
to escape a throw.  You cannot mash 1~2~1+2 and escape every throw.
If you did that you would just escape 1 escape throws as it only
registers the first button you tried to escape with.


*******************************
Character specific tricks
*******************************


**********************
Anna Williams
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Her uf+1+2 throw can be tech rolled, however if you tag throw and
they tech roll, a flying chop (f,f,N+1+2) is almost garanteed.  They
can escape it by tagging out after they tech.

uf+1,3:  If the 3 hits them non-ch, a f+1+2 is garanteed.  With CH
it's  a double over stun.  Also, uf+1~3,f+1+2 is a true combo.  Sick.

After df+1+2, d+1, N+4 is garanteed (if you are close enough)

After df+1+2 hits on a crouched opponent, f+1+2 is garanteed.  Also
garanteed is uf+1~3,f+1+2.  Sick.

If you get hit by the uf+3 grab, you can mash 4 to reduce the
damage to 5~7 points.

If they don't hold back/down to escape the stagger, CH 4, uf+1~3,
f+1+2 all combos.

Even though it's the same kick, CH 4 causes a stagger, while CH f+4
juggles.

**********************
Armor King
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,N  repeat (That's f,qcf,f,f).

Armor king handcuff glitch:

With opponent face down do db+1+3/db+2+4 without doing the punches.
Repeat until time runs out or your opponent beats you down for being
a cheap bastard.  There is no escape for the mount, and the opponent
is stunned for longer than it takes you to mount them again.  This
is fixed in PS2 TTT.

Mysterious Turn around:

I've seen this before but I haven't actually tested it, but
supposedly if you do this juggle: CD+2, 2, 1, d+1+2, and then you
hold D and your opponent holds D, when they get up first they will
be crouching, then mysteriously they will instantly be turned around
backwards, still crouching.

Ground throw anywhere:

With King, there is a somewhat known bug where you can do b+1+2, 2+4
and then get a ground throw even if you aren't next to them.  Another
less known bug is the fact that you can do b+1+2, 2+4 with king, and
then tag in armor king and still get the ground throw even if you
aren't close to them.

If Armor King escapes Kunimitsu's f+1+4 throw, he can do a BK+3 and
then get a free throw before she even recovers.


**********************
Baek Do San
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames


Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,N  repeat (That's f,qcf,f,f).

A throw is almost garanteed after uf+2 due to the guard stun.

After his b+1+2 punch parry, a throw is garanteed (12 frame
advantage).

String Cancel to Flamingo Stance: 1,2,3~F

Flamingo Cancel: Hold F or B in flamingo stance.  This allows you to
do almost any normal move from flamingo stance.  There are a few
excepts, however.  Some normal moves can still be done from the
flamingo cancel but they have a different input.  Here are the
exceptions:

   From flamingo cancel:
	1.  f+2+3 normal throw must be performed as f+2~3 from flamingo
        cancel.  Also, when done this way it has a 1+2 escape instead
        of just 2 escape as the normal f+2+3 throw has.

	2.  3,3,3,4 or 3,3,4,4 type strings must be done as:
		b+3 to get into flamingo then hold the 3, hit and hold F to
        cancel flamingo, then hit 4 while still holding the 3.  A
        standing 3 kick should then come out when you hit the 4 (not
        3+4 flying halbred).  Other strings that start with 3 (even
        a full crouched 3) can be done in a similar way.

	3.  Flying halbred (3+4) must be done as: flamingo cancel (hold
        F or B in flamingo) then N+3+4


uf+3+4 is 1 frame faster than 3+4 even though it's the same move.

WS+3,3,4, uf+3+4, f,f+4 is a true combo
CD+4,4,3 is a true combo.

**********************
Bruce Irvin
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

After a CH F+4 (not CH 4) you can get b+4,3,4

Supposedly this juggle works: Bryan CH b+1~5, bruce df+3,1, b+4,3,4.

Bruce's basic right punch gives +12 frame advantage.  I'm not sure
what's garanteed from that, but something must be.

Even though 3,2,1 doesn't launch big characters, you can always do
3,2,1,4 and still land the triple knees.

If 1+3 is tech rolled, b,f+4 is garanteed.

df+1,d+1 combos.

Not tested, but according to frame data this should combo:
ws+1,1~2,throw

**********************
Bryan Fury
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

If b+1~5 is blocked, at least a 1,2_4 combo is garanteed because
b+1~5 gives an 8 frame advantage, and bryan's basic jab is 8 frames.
The trick behind this technique is hitting the tag button.  For some
reason the hit properties change when blocked, putting extra guard
stun on the opponent.

b+1~5, even though the opponent is grounded, a ground hit will juggle
and takes away red damage.

After parrying a right punch (does the "gut punch" not mach breaker),
ff+4, df+3 is garanteed.

When bryan's taunt connects (1+3+4), a throw is garanteed.  The taunt
gives 15 frame advantage.

Bryan doesn't fall down when hit by T.Ogre's fire attacks.

**********************
Devil & Angel
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f, N, repeat.

Most people don't realize this but devil is taller than angel, and
as a result his standing laser goes over some opponent's heads (e.g.
wang, roger & alex) while angel's doesn't.

SS+2 hits the opponent extrodinarily high, with a funky tragectory.
As a result some sick tag juggles are possible.

Tagged with heihachi: ss+2~5, d+1+4.
Tagged with Yoshi:    ss+2~5, ff+1+4
Tagged with King:     ss+2~5, run cancel (ub,b) ss+3+4
                      ss+2~5, f+1+2
Tagged with Gunjack:  ss+2~5, d+4
or Ganryu
Tagged with jin/kaz:  ss+2~5, b+1+4 (B+1+4 vs big)

I'm sure there are more.  Experiment.

uf+4~3 is 1 frame faster than 4~3 even though it's the same move.

Mysterious Turn Around:

If you do the standing laser to an opponent that is all the way
across the screen (farthest you can get) and they duck under it, for
some reason they end up turning around backwards while crouched.
I've only seen it a few times.


**********************
Eddy Gordo
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

SS+1+4 sometimes hit's anywhere on the screen.  To do it you must
jump over the opponent when they are grounded.  Once you've done
that, you can attempt the SS+1+4.  It should hit the opponent even
if they are waaay out of range.  I believe this is fixed in the
latest rev of the game.

You can SS out of f+2,1,4 before you recover blocking.

You can tag on ff+3+4 on any kind of hit (ch juggle or not).

**********************
Ganryu
**********************

Basic Jab (2): 14 frames

Not many people realize this, but b+2 hits grounded opponents, but
they must be off axis like jins b+4.

Off of his punch parry, 1+2 is garanteed, d+1+2 is not, even though
it's the same move.  1+2 is an auto-combo-follow-up to the punch
parry, while doing d+1+2 does the move seperately, making it
interruptable.  Ganryu's punch parry also reverses shoulder attacks,
including his own b+1+2 unblockable.

If the second part of WS+1+2, 1+2 hits, you gain a 23 frame
advantage.  This is at least enough time for a garanteed throw or
more depending on how fast you input the move.

if 2,1 hits, d+1 is garanteed.

After FC~df+1,2,1,1 is blocked, f,f+1+2 is garanteed.

All 8 punches connect on CH f+1,2,1,2...
Only 3 punches connect on CH  2,1,2,1...



**********************
Gunjack
**********************

Basic Jab (2): 10 frames

FC,db+1, WS+4 combos together.

After a wind up punch is blocked(HCF+1), a throw is garanteed.  You
must time the throw so that it connects just as the stun is over,
otherwise the throw attempt will go right through them.

db,f+1+2 has unusually long range compared to other throws.  It
allows a fair amount of *slop* in the motion.  You can do db, SS,
f+1+2 and the throw will still come out.

2, db,f+1+2 combos together.  The throw attempt can be broken or
ducked however, but not even d+1 will interrupt it.

After d~df+1,2,1,1 is blocked, f+1+2 is garanteed.

Tag cancel:

If you hit d+1+2, 5~5 with just the right timing, gunjack won't tag
out, but instead the opponent will be knocked very high (Class 1),
allowing you to do another d+1+2,5~5.  This might be an infinite
juggle, but the timing is sick to get the tag cancel to come out.
You have about a 1 frame window.  Another oddity is that you can
throw the opponent right out of the air when you do this.

You can low throw gunjack out of his d+1+2.

Devil's laser:  When hit by devil's laser, jack automatically does
the windmill punches.  If devil trys to attack jack when he's doing
the auto windmill punches, jack automatically does p-jack's b+1+2
gaurd move.  If devil attempts to shoot jack again with the laser
while he's doing the auto windmill punches,  jack automatically does
the f+3+4 head dive under the laser.

**********************
Heihachi Mishima
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f, N, repeat.  If you do a crouch dash
(f,N,d,df) then do (N,f), ff style moves will come out.
f,N,d,df,N,f+2 will do a ff+2 demon god fist.

uf+3,4:  If you delay pressing the 4 until the 3 is just about to
hit, the 4 is garanteed.

d+1,2:  He can be jabbed in between the 1 and 2.  This is especially
deadly vs the changs as they get a CH 1~1~1.  You can also SSR
between them.  Also if your char has a quick 4 (11 frame or better)
you get a CH 4->juggle.  Finally, if the d+1 hits a crouching
opponent, they can still get a d+1 in between the d+1,2.

His right kick counter only works when doing his unblockable now.

UF+3 (the stunning one) is garanteed if they tech roll a ff+1+2
throw.

uf+4~3 is 1 frame faster than 4~3 even though it's the same move.

uf+4~3 is garanteed after 1+2 hits.

F+1 has a +3 frame advantage, while f+1 has a +1 frame advantage.
This means that F+1 recovers more quickly.  It makes juggles like
EWGF, F+1, f,F+1, f,F+1, f,F+1, WGF possible.  The juggle doesn't
work if you just use f,f+1.

Heihachi can be low thrown out of the second part of F+1,b+2,1.

CD+3 (the mid hitting version) hits big characters on the ground.

CD+3_d+3 can be done as f,N,d,df,f,uf+3_d+3.  This way seems to
execute more quickly, but I could be wrong.

Heihachi's f,f+1+4 can only be done on: Heihachi, Jin, Kuma, Kazuya,
Lei, and Paul. They can reverse this with either punch button to
headbutt them back, Heihachi can reverse this with a 1+2, you can
repeat this over and over to your heart's content

quick WGF/EWGF is garanteed after f+4.

EWGF has a 3 frame (not 1) slop factor, meaning you do f,N,d,df+2,
and you have 3 frames to hit 2 within hitting df.

These combos are garanteed (!) vs big chars:

CH ws+2, d+1+4
CH 4, d+1+4
CH CD+4,4,4,1,F+1,b+2,4

Sometimes when teamed with Wang using the tag button costumes, The
intro animation will change.  Heihachi will do his power up moves
like normal but instead of lightning animation it uses Wang's blue
sphere animation.

**********************
Hwoarang
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,N  repeat (That's f,qcf,f,f).  If you do
a crouch dash (f,N,d,df,f) then do N, f, ff style moves will come
out.  f,N,d,df,f,N,f+2 will do a ff+2 throw.

Flamingo cancel trick:  When in LFL, if you wait until he puts his
foot down and then do f+button, you will do ff style moves.  So if
you do f+3 and go into flamingo, then wait until he puts his foot
down, then do f+4, you will do the ff+4 torpedo kick.  this trick
doesn't work with RFL.

Crazy legs step:  SS+3+4, dash+3+4, CD+3+4, whatever ;).  Basically,
you interrupt any kind of special movement with the 3+4 stance
change.  What happens is that any kind of special movement (besides
a dash) changes stance to LFF and then you cancel that into RFF with
the stance change, making your legs look spazy, since you are
cancelling your movements and side steps, it actually allows you to
move faster because it eliminates the delay at the end of the special
movement (due to the cancelling effect).

Long range throw: 1+2 (disrespect stance) then throw. Because of the
turn around animation, the reach is further.

Triple flamingo sidestep:
SSR, f+3, SSR

Double flamingo sidestep from RFF:
f+4, SSL

Triple flamingo SSL from LFF:
SSL, f,N+4, SSL

ff+4,df+2, 1, 2, 4 is garanteed off of a CH 4, IF the opponent
doesn't hold back/down.  If they hold back/down they fall over and
it doesn't connect, but most people don't know this.  Also, if you
get hit by ff+4 and they attempt the df+2, if you attempt a throw,
the df+2 won't juggle because your throw attempt turns you around.
Just remember to hold d or b when you attempt the throw otherwise
they will be able to hit you with ff+4 *again* because of the stagger
that df+2 causes.  You can also escape CH 4, ff+4 by tagging out
after the ff+4.

uf+3,4,3:  If you delay pressing the 4 until the first 3 is just
about to hit, the 4, 3 ender is garanteed.

uf+3,4,3:  When blocked this move only displays the 3,4 part getting
blocked.  The last 3 only comes out when the 4 connects, but if you
enter the move as uf+3,4,3 anyway, the guard stun on the opponent is
much longer, giving you frame advantage.

After LFF, ff+4,3 is block, f+3 is garanteed vs Xiaoyu only.

After RFF, 3~4 is blocked, df+4 is garanteed.

After the fourth hit of his ten string, he ends in LFF, but he
"passes" through RFF for a fraction of a second, allowing you to do
RFF moves if you are quick enough.

His ff+2 is a right punch escape, but the throw animation is a
left punch animation (left hand is out further during the throw
attempt animation).

In LFF, you can press f+3+4, then f+3_4 to do RFF ff styles moves.
From LFF, f+3+4 changes stances but also registers a f, then doing
f+button registers as ff+button.  This also works from RFF.

After the opponent blocks uf+3,4,3, df+2 is garanteed(?)



**********************
Jack-2
**********************

Basic Jab (2): 10 frames

db,f+1+2 connects after a CH 3.  db,f+1+2 has unusually long range,
and it also has a *slop* factor to it's input.  You can do db, SS,
f+1+2 and the throw still comes out.

After a wind up punch is blocked(HCF+1), a throw is garanteed.  You
must time the throw so that it connects just as the stun is over,
otherwise the throw attempt will go right through them.

2, db,f+1+2 combos together.  The throw attempt can be broken or
ducked though, but not even d+1 will interrupt it.

After FC~df+1,2,1,1 is blocked, f+1+2 is garanteed.

Tag cancel:

If you hit d+1+2, 5~5 with just the right timing, jack-2 won't tag
out, but instead the opponent will be knocked very high (Class 1),
allowing you to do another d+1+2,5~5.  This might be an infinite
juggle, but the timing is sick to get the tag cancel to come out.
You have about a 1 frame window.  Another oddity is that you can
throw the opponent right out of the air when you do this.

You can low throw jack-2 out of his d+1+2.

Devil's laser:  When hit by devil's laser, jack automatically does
the windmill punches.  If devil trys to attack jack when he's doing
the auto windmill punches, jack automatically does p-jack's b+1+2
gaurd move.  If devil attempts to shoot jack again with the laser
while he's doing the auto windmill punches,  jack automatically does
the f+3+4 head dive under the laser.

**********************
Jin Kazama
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f, N, repeat.  If you do a crouch dash
(f,N,d,df,f) then do N, f, ff style moves will come out.
f,N,d,df,f,N,f+2 will do a ff+2 straight punch.

UF+3 (the stunning one) is garanteed if they tech roll a ff+1+2
throw.

Jin's WGF/EWGF hit's Sm if you buffer it with tag.

uf+4~3 is 1 frame faster than 4~3 even though it's the same move.

His ten string ff+2,1,4,4,2,4,3,2,1 has an odd property in that if
you stop at the 5th hit, it recovers crouching.

His 1+3 throw has different properties when teamed with Jun or
Kazuya.  The opponent hits the ground "harder" allowing a garanteed
d+3 or dash in b+4.

These combos are garanteed(!) vs big chars:
CH b+4, b+1+4
Devil Jin 1+2, B+1+4

Jin's WR+3 can be done as f,N,d,df,f,uf+3.  You have to hit the 3 at
the exact moment you hit uf, otherwise you'll just get the
"demon hop" move.

EWGF has a 3 frame (not 1) slop factor, meaning you do f,N,d,df+2,
and you have 3 frames to hit 2 within hitting df.

**********************
Jun Kazama
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Her 1+4 when done against a ducking big character causes them to
stand due to a wierd guard break (hellsweep), making it very hard for
big characters to get out of it by blocking low.  Normal characters
can just block the first part low and do a WS move or d+1 after the
1+4.

Unlike Jin, when d+3+4 is blocked high, it you must active block it
otherwise it will juggle.

WS+3 is garanteed after CH FC,df+2

**********************
Julia Chang
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

You can get a mad axe throw by doing qcb, SS, f+2.  It still comes
out.  The mad axe throw also has extra long range compared to other
throws.

triple side step:  SSR, 3+4, SSR

You can hop kick and get a full lift after d,df+1,(CH) 2 but not
after (CH) D,df+2

f,F+1 has a much longer recovery time than f,f+1.  The reason for
this is that you can do f,F+1, 4 and delay the 4, but with f,f+1,4
you can't delay it.

Hitting tag during a blocked f+1+2 puts you at a whopping 5 times
disadvantage that you would normally be at without buffering tag.
Also f+1+2~5 will tag on any kind of hit (ch juggle or not).

df+2,1 is garanteed after blocking all of law's flip kick combos
that recover crouching.  Be warned that law has the option to recover
crouching or standing after a lot of his flip kick combos though
(like d+2,3), but there are some that always recover crouching (3,4)
and some that always recover standing (4,u+3).

(From MIC) If you know the opponent is going to try and tech roll
you can do this juggle: uf+4, 1, ff+1, ff+1, df+1 (whiff) ~1 (hits
them as they tech roll), 1, ff+1, ff+1, d,df+1, 2.  They have to tech
roll to their left for this to work.

**********************
Kazuya Mishima
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f, N, repeat.  If you do a crouch dash
(f,N,d,df,f) then do N, f, ff style moves will come out.
f,N,d,df,f,N,f+3 will do a ff+3 overhead kick.

UF+3 (the stunning one) is garanteed if they tech roll a ff+1+2
throw.

uf+4~3 is 1 frame faster than 4~3 even though it's the same move.

His nine string ff+2,1,4,4,2,4,3,2,1 has an odd property in that if
you stop at the 5th hit, it recovers crouching.

This combo is garanteed(!) vs big chars:
f+1+2, B+1+4

**********************
King
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,N  repeat (That's f,qcf,f,f).  If you do
a crouch dash (f,N,d,df) then do N, f, ff style moves will come out.
f,N,d,df,f,N,f+4 will do a ff+4 convict kick.  You can also buffer
the giant swing this way:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,hcf+1.

2,1,f,hcf+1 combos together.

1,2,1,f,hcf+1 combos together.

2,1, 2,1, b+4, BK 3 is a true combo.  Does this work in TTT?

King can reverse the ankle kick (grounded face up/feet towards d+3).

If King escapes Kunimitsu's f+1+4 throw, he can do a BK+3 and then
get a free throw before she even recovers.

King->A.King is an inescapable throw.  b+1+2~5.

Bug: After b+1+2, 2+4, King can ground throw the opponent, even if
he's not near the opponent.

King's elbow drop (U+2+4) is garanteed after a kick reversal.


**********************
Kuma & Panda
**********************

Basic Jab (f+1): 8 frames

After a HBS 1+2~5, a flying chop (ff,n+1+2) juggles.  It's about the
only thing that is garanteed after that.

You can low parry Kuma's df+1+2 headbutt

You can low parry Kuma's b+1+2 unblockable.

**********************
Kunimitsu
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

If f+3+4 is blocked, the opponent gets a side throw.


df+2~5 causes a wierd (hellsweep) guard break when blocked.  It also
juggles even on crouching opponents, no CH required.  Very abusable.


**********************
Lee Chaolan
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Advanced silver fang (different, causes guard stun): b+1, N+1, N+2,
NOT b+1,b+1, b+2.  Update: Ok, so I was wrong.  You can do it like
b+1,b+1,b+2.  It's all in the timing of the second b+1.  If you do it
just as the first b+1 hits, it will do the advanced silver fang.

UF+3 (the stunning one) is garanteed if they tech roll a ff+3+4
throw.

Lee's mist step (f,N) is considered standing (you'll do standing
moves out of it) even though it ducks under high attacks and looks
like a crouch dash.  It also can be interrupted into anything, at
any time.  So you can do a psuedo wave step via f,N,f,N,...

Lee can tag on b+4 whether it hits or not.

If you get the side throw where he steps on the opponents face and
laughs, you'll get a special win animation (he laughs more).  (From
Castel) If you get this side throw vs Bryan, sometimes Bryan will
actually laugh back and regain some energy.  It doesn't happen 100%
of the time though.

In hitman stance, a basic jab (1) can be interrupted into the hitman
3 kick.  Example: 3+4, 1~3, the jab animation gets interrupted by
the kick animation.

After d+1, ws+3,d+3,3,3 cannot be interrupted (even by yoshi's b+1+4)

**********************
Lei Wu Long
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Silent back step: b+3+4,b, repeat

HaHa step: b,b,3~4+b, repeat

HeHe step: b,b,4~3+b, repeat

Lei spaz:  b+3+4~b+3+4~b+3+4.... cancel back turn into another back
turn very quickly.  Looks funny but I don't know of any uses for it.
It can also be done with any of the "HaHa" motions, i.e.
b+3~4 ~ b+3~4, ...

Lei stutter: b+3+4~d, repeat.  Looks kind of like haha step but it
doesn't go anywhere.  Useless but funny.

Lei the balarina: CNS, f~b~f~b...  Watch those tippy toes!

WS+3 hits grounded opponents off axis like jin's b+4.

PNS 2 hits grounded opponents off axis like jin's b+4.

b+1, 4~3 is garanteed.

Electric slide forward: f~N,b, repeat.  There is a certain rythym to
it, but if done right it can be really effective and looks funky.
It's basically cancelling a crab walk into another crab walk.

If 1,2,1 connects on CH, a BK d+1 juggle is garanteed

Razor Rush:  You can SSL between the first and second punch, SSR
between second and third, SSL between third and forth, etc.  If they
don't delay any punches, the next punch in the rush WILL hit you if
you attempt the sidestep, but the next punch after that will wiff and
you can then do an attack to lei's side.  Example, they razor rush,
you SSR between the 2nd and 3rd punch.  The 3rd punch hits you, the
4th wiffs and you hop kick->juggle.  If there is any delay at all in
the razor rush, you will sidestep right out of it untouched,
but you still have to sidestep in the correct direction depending on
the punch.  Unfortunately big chars can't get out of it this way, as
even when they SS correctly, they are too big to not get hit by the
rest of the rush.

**********************
Ling Xiaoyu
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

BK turn glitch:
AoP: 1+3~D, D,D/B+3+4  Sometimes xiaoyu just ends up back turned when
you do this without any animation for it.

Triple SSR: SSR, 3+4, SSR
Triple SSR with Raindance: SSR, b+3+4, SSR

Triple SSL: SSL, b+1+2, SSL
Triple SSL with Raindance:  SSL, b+1+2, d+1+4, D/B+3+4 (sometimes
causes BK turn glitch)

df+2~1 hits grounded opponents.

You can low throw ling when she is in AoP.

(BK 4)_(BK uf+4) is garanteed after a CH BK d+3 to opponents BK.

When ling's taunt (2+3+4) connects, a throw is garanteed (if you are
close enough).  The taunt gives 15 frame advantage on connect.

After 1+3, db+3 will go through them and you'll end up at their BK.
More BK setup fun!

**********************
Forest Law
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

According to the frame data, law's basic 4 is now at 10 frames in
TTT.  This makes it as fast as some character's basic jabs.

Funny super charge: b~f~b~f....  Because of the way he dances, this
looks really funny.

Law can slide low: D,df,d,df.    Most people just do the slide kick
but it's actually useful just as a movement option.  You can also
slide close to them and do a ws+2.

UF+3 (the stunning one) is garanteed if they tech roll a ff+3+4
throw.

Most people don't know about it, but law has this cheezy 2 hit
combo: 1+2+3+4, 1,3. You have to supercharge to get it to come out.

**********************
Michelle Chang
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames


A little known juggle: (CH) ff+1, 4, ff+1, ff+1, ff+1, ff+1, 4.
Because michelles elbow doesn't knock away like julia's, the whole
combo is garanteed off of a single CH elbow.

Michelle has no double escape throws.

Michelle can hop kick with full lift after a CH d,D/F+2 (her new
stun move)

SS+2 recovers crouching, has +5 advantage on hit and has no block
disadvantage.

SS+2, ws+4 combos together.


If you know the opponent is going to try and tech roll you can do
this juggle: uf+4, 1, ff+1, ff+1, df+1 (whiff) ~1 (hits them as they
tech roll), 1, ff+1, ff+1, ff+1, ff+1,4. They have to tech roll to
their left for this to work.



**********************
Mokujin/Testujin
**********************

When immitating Roger & Alex, his db+3 hits anywhere on the screen.
I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

When teamed with Julia, and mokujin is immitating julia (or visa
versa with michelle), doing the b+2~5 tag throw causes the opponent
to freeze, stuck until hit again or time runs out.  From there you
can just tag mokujin in and out until you get Jack and do the 5x
windup punch o' death.  I believe this bug is fixed in the latest
rev.

Gold testujin:  You get gold testujin when you pick testujin after
getting 10 wins.  Gold tetsujin has the unique property of giving
whoever he is teamed up with a netsu power up after 5 hits.  This
works for characters that usually don't ever get netsu powered up
like ogre and jack-2.

**********************
Nina Williams
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Her uf+1+2 throw can be tech rolled, however if you tag throw and
they tech roll, a flying chop (f,f,N+1+2) is almost garanteed.  They
can escape it by tagging out after they tech.

Hayashida step: half circle from D to B to U.  Repeat.  Nina does
the sway back cancelled into a SS.  Looks really wierd when done
correctly.

Even though it's the same kick, CH 4 causes a stagger, while CH f+4
juggles.

Anna blows Nina's evil mist back at her, making evil mist->db+3+4
impossible on her.

CH 4, d,DF+2 combos.

SS+1~b~uf+1+2 combos.

**********************
Ogre
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

uf+3,4,3:  If you delay pressing the 4 until the 3 is just about to
hit, the 4, 3 is garanteed.

uf+3,4,3:  When blocked this move only displays the 3,4 part getting
blocked.  The last 3 only comes out when the 4 connects, but if you
enter the move as uf+3,4,3 anyway, the guard stun on the opponent is
much longer, giving you frame advantage.

df+1, d+1 combos.

After d+1, ws+3,d+3,3,3 cannot be interrupted (even by yoshi's b+1+4)

**********************
Paul Phoenix
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

f+2, d+3.  In TK3, If they blocked the 2, the 3 was garanteed.  This
has been fixed in TTT.

If you are tackled and they throw a right punch, 1, 1, 2 will grab
their arm and break it (not the same as the arm bar reversal).

d+1,2:  He can be jabbed in between the 1 and 2.  This is especially
deadly vs the changs as they get a CH 1~1~1.  You can also SSR
between them.  Also if your char has a quick 4 (11 frame or better)
you get a CH 4->juggle.  Finally, if the d+1 hits a crouching
opponent, they can still get a d+1 in between the d+1,2.

Hayashida step: half circle from D to B to U.  Repeat.  Paul does the
sway back cancelled into a SS.  Looks really wierd when done
correctly.

His ff+1+2~5 to Hwoarang/Baek db+3+4 is escapable.  Just mash 3 and
you'll sweep them at the last second.

If they block the faceup/feet-towards b,b+3+4 dive, a jab will juggle
them out of their guard break.


**********************
Prototype Jack
**********************

Basic Jab (2): 10 frames

Funky step: b+1+2~f, repeat.  Basically repeated cancels of his super
guard move.

After a wind up punch is blocked(HCF+1), a throw is garanteed.  You
must time the throw so that it connects just as the stun is over,
otherwise the throw attempt will go right through them.

d+1,2:  He can be jabbed in between the 1 and 2.  This is especially
deadly vs the changs as they get a CH 1~1~1.  You can also SSR
between them.  Also if your char has a quick 4 (11 frame or better)
you get a CH 4->juggle.  Finally, if the d+1 hits a crouching
opponent, they can still get a d+1 in between the d+1,2.

(From MIC)  If you know the opponent is going to tech roll to their
left, you can do this juggle:  SS+1, UF+4, 2, SS+1.  The last SS+1
is garanteed if they tech roll to their left.

Xiaoyu crys her death cry when you spank her with the right side
throw.

SS+1 hits on the ground on off axis opponents like jin's b+4.

SS+1 causes a guard stagger, SS+1~5 doesn't. :(

Besides the side throw, P-Jack has no 1 escape throws
(only 2 and 1+2).

After FC~df+1,2,1,1 is blocked, f+1+2 is garanteed.

Devil's laser:  When hit by devil's laser, jack automatically does
the windmill punches.  If devil trys to attack jack when he's doing
the auto windmill punches, jack automatically does p-jack's b+1+2
gaurd move.  If devil attempts to shoot jack again with the laser
while he's doing the auto windmill punches,  jack automatically does
the f+3+4 head dive under the laser.

**********************
Roger & Alex
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

Wave step:  f,N,d,df,f,N,f,N  repeat (That's f,qcf,f,f).

If f,N+1 is blocked, f,N, d, df+1 is garanteed.   f, N+1 gives
41(!) frame advantage on block.

db+3 hit's low but is not low parriable.

You can low parry roger's df+1+2 headbutt

1, d+1,N+2 combos together.

**********************
True Ogre
**********************

Basic Jab: 10 frames

uf+3,4,3:  If you delay pressing the 4 until the 3 is just about
to hit, the 4, 3 is garanteed.

uf+3,4,3:  When blocked this move only displays the 3,4 part getting
blocked.  The last 3 only comes out when the 4 connects, but if you
enter the move as uf+3,4,3 anyway, the guard stun on the opponent is
much longer, giving you frame advantage.

D,f+2 hits on the ground.

Holding d/f with true ogre causes him to reverse low, Sm, and some
Mid attacks (like Yoshi's df+2 uppercut).  Generally, it reverses any
move with the notation d/b_d_d/f + 1_2. The reversal is a throw, and
the escape for the throw is 1.

After d+1, ws+3,d+3,3,3 cannot be interrupted (even by yoshi's b+1+4)

**********************
Wang Jin Rei
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

A throw is garanteed after a SS+1+2 due to the guard stun.  QCF+4 is
also garanteed.

Sick wanning moon tags:

df,DF+2+4~5->panda uf+1+2, BK 1+3
df,DF+2+4~5->yoshi f,F+1+4

The df,DF+2+4~5 to panda uf+1+2, BK 1+3 IS escapable.  Just hold down
and you will recover crouching out of the wanning moon, ducking the
back throw attempt.

The df,DF+2+4~5-> yoshi suicide is also escapable.  Just tag out at
the last second and it will wiff.

Tag cancel: db+4, 2, 5~5.  If you do this correctly, wang will start
the motion, and then just stop in the middle of the punch.  You can
also do db+4,2,5~2 and the first punch will be interrupted into a
second punch.  It looks kind of like their is a crouch dash between
the db+4 and 2.  Also, if you do this and hold up or down, wang will
do what looks like db+4~CD~SS~db+2.  If it wasn't so damn hard to do
(maybe 1 frame window), it would be very useful.


**********************
Yoshimitsu
**********************

Basic Jab: 8 frames

You can SSL out of the first and second hit of the door knocker.

His b,b+1 hits big chars on the ground.

In close, his b+1+4 hits all large characters without them even
moving.

If you tap b,d/b at the right time, you can recover BK out of his
SS+3+4.

The last two hits of his b+1+4, 1+2, u~uf, 1+2 are escapable.  You
must tech roll to the right after you get hit by the pogostick and
then hold back.

df+2~5 causes a wierd (hellsweep) guard break when blocked.  It also
juggles even on crouching opponents, no CH required.  Very abusable.

You can b+3+4 out of almost any string in the game (like Jin's 1,1,2
or lei's razor rush).  Sometimes you need to do more than one spin
because of tracking though.

You can low throw yoshi when he's in the death stance (b+1+2).

Bug:  If you block yoshi's 4,4,4, your character will run backwards
to the end of the screen then forwards again.  You have to hit tag
when you block the last 4 to get this bug to work.

If they block the faceup/feet-towards b,b+3+4 dive, a jab will
juggle them out of their guard break.
